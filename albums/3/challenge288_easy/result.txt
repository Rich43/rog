peter piper picked peck pickled peppers 
bugs bunny dance slow simple shuffle 
never better bit butter

daily diary 
sky sea, sea sky 
grey geese green grazing, grey geese green grazing. 
but better butter batter better. 
soul swooned slowly snow falling faintly universe faintly falling,like their end, all 
whisper words wisdom, 
they paved paradise put parking 
so gonna dessert disaster?

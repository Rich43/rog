'''
As a crude form of hashing function, Lars wants to sum the digits of a number.
Then he wants to sum the digits of the result, and repeat until he have only
one digit left. He learnt that this is called the digital root of a number,
but the Wikipedia article is just confusing him.

Can you help him implement this problem in your favourite programming language?

It is possible to treat the number as a string and work with each character at a
time. This is pretty slow on big numbers, though, so Lars wants you to at least
try solving it with only integer calculations (the modulo operator may prove to
be useful!).
